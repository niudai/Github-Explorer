# *Remote - Github* 0.3.0 Release

*Remote - Github* is currently in **preview**, thank you all for trying it. 

I recevied a lot of different views, most of them are helpful. Thanks to every one using *Remote - Github*, it would be better with your feedbacks.

Here's what's new in 0.3.0:

## Big Feature

**Create Remote Github Repository In VSCode**

In order to set up a remote repo, usually we need to open browser and create a repo in github manually, and then push the local repo to it.

With *Remote - Github*, you can create remote github repo right in VS Code and sync with your local repo automatically.

Just invoke `Remote - Github: Create Remote Github Repository` command, and input the repo name and description:

select repo type, public or private:

Wait a sec, the repo would be created:

click `see it` to see the repo in browser:

Once repo is created, *Remote - Github* would open a new terminal, and run several commands to set up your local repo to sync with your remote repo:

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>
git push -u origin master
```

Notice that `git init` would have no effect if your local repo has already set up git. Just don't worry it.

### Known Issues

Some people say they cannot sign in because `Cannot read property 'data' of undefined`. I tried to fix this problem, and I found it's related to vscode proxy. 

I cannot control whether requests are made under proxy or not, it seems it's controlled by vscode. VSCode has the same behavior as Chrome, and both of them would read System settings. 

I cannot fix this problem at this stage, but disable proxy settings of your os would help at most time.

Wish somebody come up and fix this.
